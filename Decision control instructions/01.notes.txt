Nested if-else:-

Need of nested if-else - when a decision is to be given by code or program is based on more than one condition, we use nested if-else

x= 100
y=20
z=50

if condition 1:
	if condition 2:
		if block
	else:
		else block
else:
	if condition 3:
		if block
	else:
		else block


Why not nested if-else:-
Care need to be taken to match corresponding pairs of is's and else's
Care need to be taken for indentation


Need of logical operators
1. If there is a need to check more than one condition in single if-statement, use logical operators.
2. To overcome disadvantages of nested if-else use logical operators.

1) logical OR = or
2) logical AND = and
3) logical NOT = not

logical OR and AND are binary operators (2 conditions)
logical NOT = Unary operator (1 condition)
Operators for logical operators are conditions.
