Variables
They are containers that are used to store values. Values can be an input given by user or a result of any operation.
Technically vairables are memory location on RAM. Value in the variable remains till program is running/or in execution phase, as soon as program ends that value is erased(lost).

Constant
Whose values remain same throughtout program or operation. They are denoted by capital letters.
For ex- PI=3.14

Keywords
These are reserved pre-defined words in programming language.
Ex- if, else, for...

Instruction
Command given to machine is called as instruction.
Types - Arithmetic, Decision control, Loops control

Program
It is a set of instructions executed sequencially.


Need of datatype
Python is a dynamically typed language,i.e python interpreter assigns smartly datatype to a variable as per value assigned to it.
For ex - x=10, datatype of x is int
y=10.5, datatype of y is float

With this datatype interpreter allocates memory space for that variable on the RAM.
