#Object Oriented Programming

Need of OOPS
1) Security
2) User defined datatypes

OOPS is a design that uses classes and object in program. It aims to implement concepts of inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation.

What is class?
Class is a blueprint or a template from which object is created. Class is a collection or bundle of data and functionality. (for ex - an admission form in class having collection of user data)

Syntax
class classname
    attributes/property
    [data member, methods]

What is entity?
One that can be uniquely identified from its group is called as entity.

Object
Object is a real world entity that is created or manufactured from class. Object can be defined as a data field that has unique data members (attributes) and methods (behaviour).

Class form = blueprint
data like name, roll, % etc of multiple students are objects (obj1,obj2....)
