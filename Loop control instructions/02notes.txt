Loop control instruction
need - resualibility of code

Disadvantage of code repetition
1) Memory - it increases memory consumption as program is stored in the memory for its conversion to machine code.
2) Time consuming - intepreter time is consumed for checking repeated code.
3) Length of program - it increases program length which may cause difficulty to find errors for a developer.

Above disadvantages of code repetition can be removed by using loop control instruction.

What is loop control instruction?
The instruction or statement that allows you to write code once and repeat finite and infinite number of times is called as loop control instruction.

Types of LCI:
1) While loop
2) For loop

Syntax
initialization
while condition:
	code
	increment/decrement

initialization -> condition -> body -> increment/decrement


Initialization
In this a variable is initialized to a certain value. That variable is called as counter variable which keeps track of number of times loop is repeated.
Generally the variable used in initialization, same variable is used in condition and increment/decrement.

Question:
WAP to print the table of 4

Find summation from 1 to n.

Factorial of a number entered by user.

A number and its power is entered by user. WAP to find one number raised to power.

A number is entered by user. WAP to count number of digits in that entered number.

Any digit number is entered by user, WAP to check weather number is armstrong number or not.

WAP to print fibonacci series.


Break Keyword
Its a keyword which is used to stop execution of your loop even if loop condition is true.
Break keyword is always associated with if condition.

Syntax
for i in range(start,stop,step)
      if condition:
      break
initialization
while condition:
      if condition:
      break
increment/decrement
